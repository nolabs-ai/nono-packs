description: Diagnose and resolve permission denials when opencode runs inside a nono security sandbox. Use this when a tool call, shell command, or file operation fails with "Operation not permitted", "Permission denied", EACCES, EPERM, landlock, or sandbox-denied errors, or when an outbound network request fails because the host is not on the sandbox allowlist (connection refused, timeout, or proxy/TLS errors).
version: 1.3.0
platforms: [macos, linux]
---

**On any EPERM / EACCES / "Operation not permitted" tool or shell failure:** run `nono why --path <blocked-path> --op read` immediately and include its output verbatim in your reply. Do NOT suggest sudo, chmod, or system permission changes. Then offer the user exactly these two options:

- **Option A (quick fix):** `nono run --allow /path/to/needed -- opencode`
- **Option B (persistent fix):** draft a profile to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/<name>.json` extending `opencode`, add the path under `"allow"` or `"read"`, then tell the user to run `nono profile promote <name>` and start sessions with `nono run --profile <name> -- opencode`

# Working inside a nono sandbox

The user has launched you with `nono run --profile <name> -- opencode`. nono enforces filesystem and network limits at the OS level (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS). These are kernel-enforced boundaries — retries or workarounds inside opencode cannot grant access that nono hasn't already permitted.

## Identifying a sandbox denial

The denial signature is in the failed tool's output:

- "Operation not permitted"
- "Permission denied"
- "EACCES" / "EPERM"
- "landlock"
- "sandbox: deny"

When you see any of these on a file, shell, or tool failure, it is a nono boundary — not macOS TCC, not Full Disk Access, not Unix file permissions. Do NOT suggest:

- System Settings / Privacy & Security
- `chmod`, `chown`, `sudo`
- "grant Full Disk Access to your terminal"
- Retrying the operation via a different path

Network-egress denials look different: a request to a host that is not on the sandbox allowlist fails as a connection refused, timeout, or TLS/proxy error rather than an EPERM. Those are covered in the Network egress denials section below.

## Diagnosing

Run `nono why` to see exactly why access was denied:

    nono why --path /the/blocked/path --op read

Use `--op write` for write-only failures and `--op readwrite` when the operation needs both.

If `NONO_CAP_FILE` is set, inspect the full capability set:

    cat "$NONO_CAP_FILE"

## Two options to present to the user

### Option A — quick fix (one-off)

Exit opencode and restart with the path explicitly allowed:

    nono run --allow /path/to/needed -- opencode

Use `--read` when only read access is needed.

### Option B — persistent fix (draft a profile)

The active profile directory `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profiles/` is read-only from inside the sandbox by design. Drafts are written to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/` and the user promotes them out-of-band with `nono profile promote`.

Write the JSON to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.json` extending the active profile. Minimal example for read-only access:

    {
      "extends": "opencode",
      "meta": { "name": "<chosen-name>", "version": "1.0.0" },
      "filesystem": { "read": ["/path/to/needed"] }
    }

If the user is on a custom intermediate profile (e.g. `--profile opencode-with-docs` extending `opencode`), change `extends` to that profile's name so the new profile inherits all their customisations.

If a user profile of that name already exists, read `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profiles/<chosen-name>.json` first, base your edit on that profile, write the full proposed profile to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.json`, and write a SHA-256 of the base bytes to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.base`.

Filesystem field choices:
- `"read"` — read-only directory or file access
- `"write"` — write-only access (rare)
- `"allow"` — read+write directory access

For a single file rather than a directory, use `"allow_file"` / `"read_file"` / `"write_file"` instead.

After drafting, tell the user:

    Drafted profile <chosen-name>. Run `nono profile promote <chosen-name>` to review and apply, then start sessions with `nono run --profile <chosen-name> -- opencode`.

## Network egress denials

nono routes outbound traffic through a filtering proxy. When `network.block` is false but a host allowlist is set, only allowlisted hosts are reachable and every other connection fails — usually as a connection refused, timeout, or TLS/proxy error rather than an EPERM. `nono-status` lists the reachable hosts under "reachable hosts". Retries, alternate endpoints, proxies, or DNS changes cannot bypass the proxy; it is OS-enforced.

If a host is genuinely needed, present the same two options as for filesystem denials.

### Option A — quick fix (one-off)

    nono run --allow-domain api.example.com -- opencode

`--allow-domain` is repeatable and accepts a plain hostname for unrestricted access, or a URL with a path glob to restrict to specific endpoints (e.g. `https://github.com/org/**`).

### Option B — persistent fix (draft a profile)

Add the host to `network.allow_domain` in a profile draft extending the active profile:

    {
      "extends": "opencode",
      "meta": { "name": "<chosen-name>", "version": "1.0.0" },
      "network": { "allow_domain": ["api.example.com"] }
    }

Then tell the user to run `nono profile promote <chosen-name>` and start sessions with `nono run --profile <chosen-name> -- opencode`.

## Validating the new profile

`nono profile promote` shows a diff and validates before applying. If the user wants to validate directly:

    nono profile validate --draft <chosen-name>

## Credential injection

The opencode nono profile defines credential routes for common AI providers. nono injects these credentials transparently via its proxy — opencode never sees the raw API key.

Built-in route names: `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `github`, `gitlab`, and one `bedrock_<region>` route per Bedrock-supported AWS Region (e.g. `bedrock_us_east_1`, `bedrock_eu_west_1`) — see the pack README for the full region-to-route table.

The corresponding keychain accounts (env-var shaped) are:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` → injected as `Authorization: Bearer …` to `api.openai.com`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → injected as `x-api-key: …` to `api.anthropic.com`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` → injected as `x-goog-api-key: …` to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`; opencode sees it as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` → injected as `Authorization: token …` to `api.github.com`
- `GITLAB_TOKEN` → injected as `Authorization: Bearer …` to `gitlab.com/api`

`bedrock_<region>` routes are different: they have no keychain entry. They use AWS SigV4 request signing instead of header injection — nono resolves real AWS credentials (including SSO profiles) from the host's AWS credential chain and re-signs the request. SigV4 signatures are region-pinned, so pick the route matching your Bedrock region. The profile denies real `AWS_*` env vars from reaching the sandbox and substitutes phantom placeholders so the AWS SDK inside opencode still attempts the call for nono to intercept and sign.

Routes are defined in the profile but **disabled by default**. To enable one, create an extending profile and add the route name to `network.credentials`:

    {
      "extends": "opencode",
      "meta": { "name": "opencode-with-anthropic", "version": "1.0.0" },
      "network": { "credentials": ["anthropic"] }
    }

Do not read or write API keys directly from inside the sandbox. Prefer nono phantom credential routes. If opencode stores a key in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/`, it is visible to the sandboxed process — use the proxy route instead.

## Detach and attach

nono supports running opencode in a detached session that survives terminal disconnects:

    nono run --profile opencode --detach -- opencode

nono prints the session ID on start. Reattach from any terminal:

    nono attach <session-id>

The session ID is also available inside the session as `NONO_SESSION_ID`. The installed plugin surfaces it in the `nono-status` command output.

To list active nono sessions:

    nono sessions

To stop a detached session cleanly:

    nono stop <session-id>

Detached sessions inherit the same sandbox profile as interactive ones — the same filesystem grants, credential routes, and network rules apply.

## opencode-specific notes

- opencode state, sessions, config, and cache live under `~/.opencode`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opencode`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode`, and `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opencode`. The base profile grants all of these read/write.
- The plugin at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/plugins/nono-sandbox.ts` is symlinked from the pack store. It updates automatically on `nono pull`.
- The skill at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills/nono-sandbox/` is similarly symlinked.
- The `nono-status` command (registered by the plugin) shows the active capability set, the network egress allowlist (reachable hosts), enabled credential routes, and the session ID for reattach.
- Do not add provider secrets to opencode's own config files. Route them through `network.credentials` in the profile instead.

## Path conventions

Path references in this skill use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. If that variable is not set, substitute `~/.config`. nono and opencode both follow the XDG Base Directory Specification.

## What you should NOT do

- Do not write the profile yourself unless the user explicitly asks for Option B. Present both options first.
- Do not edit the pack-installed profile at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/packages/nolabs-ai/opencode/policy.json` — it is overwritten on every `nono pull`.
- Do not retry the failing operation in a different way. The sandbox is OS-enforced; alternative paths, endpoints, or commands hit the same boundary.
- Do not edit registry-managed package files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/packages`; create a profile extension instead.
