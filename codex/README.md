# nono codex

Sandbox profile and Codex plugin for running [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex) inside a [nono](https://nono.sh) security sandbox.

Install:

```
nono run --profile codex -- codex
```

If the pack isn't already installed, nono will prompt to pull it.

## What's in the pack

- **`policy.json`** — sandbox profile (loaded as `--profile codex`). Grants `~/.codex`, `~/.agents`, `~/.config/nono/{profiles,packages}` (read-only), the OpenAI auth origin, and runtime groups for Node, Rust, Python, Nix.
- **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** — Codex plugin manifest, exposes the `nono-sandbox` skill.
- **`bin/nono-hook.sh`** — compatibility no-op for older installs that still have the previous `PostToolUse` hook entry.
- **`bin/nono-hook-session.sh`** — compatibility no-op for older installs that still have the previous `SessionStart` hook entry.
- **`skills/nono-sandbox/SKILL.md`** — skill describing how to diagnose and resolve sandbox denials.

## Activating the hooks

`nono pull always-further/codex` writes the marketplace registration, the hook entries, and the cache symlink, but leaves your `config.toml` alone — that file often contains user customisations and a clean TOML merge isn't worth the risk of clobbering them. After accepting the install prompt you'll see a one-line reminder if the flag isn't set.

## Hook noise

Codex currently renders hook output in the TUI, even for hook entries marked `"silent": true`. This pack avoids that channel: fresh installs do not register Codex hooks. Sandbox-denial handling is provided by the `nono-sandbox` skill instead.
